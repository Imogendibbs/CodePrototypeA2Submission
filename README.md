The Daily Gratitude Wall


The Daily Gratitude Wall is an interactive visualisation project that transforms users’ words of gratitude into a dynamic, evolving collage. Each word or phrase entered by the user is represented as a visual data point, with randomised placement, colour, and font, creating a growing mural of gratitude.

Many people struggle to maintain a consistent gratitude practice. By providing an engaging, interactive digital tool, this project encourages reflection and supports mental well-being.

The project aims to explore the intersection of coding and affective data, allowing emotions to be expressed, visualised, and experienced in a new way.

I wanted to develop a creative coding project that bridges emotional reflection and coding.


Technologies Used:

Processing (Python Mode) – v4.1
Python – v3.11
Open-Source Code Libraries & Tutorials 


Features:

Acknowledgements:

This project was inspired by my interest in creative coding and mental well-being.

Concepts of coding, datafication and big data were informed by Van Dijck (2014), Kitchin (2014), Berry (2011) and Ford (2015)

Processing and LinkedIn tutorials were used to assist my project.
