To use the Daily Gratitude Wall, select the textbox so the outline becomes highlighted pink. This means the program is ready to receive entries. Once selected, begin typing something you are grateful for into the textbox, then press ENTER/RETURN. 
The program will add your gratitude to the wall in a random position. As you enter more words/phrases of gratitude, they will appear scattered on the wall with randomised colours and fonts. In the end, you are left with a visual collage of your personal gratitudes.
